The website has a single component. To be entered into the lobby of players, one must log in. If you don't already have an account, you can easily create one from the link on the homepage. Once you've successfully logged in, you'll be redirected to the playing lobby.
Once you're in the lobby, you'll have access to the players table where all the available players will be listed. If you fancy playing a game with any one of them, you can click on their link to send an invite. Once you've sent an invite, the other player would be prompted to accept your invitation. If the other player declines, oh well! Try again with a different player.
In the scenario when the other player accepts your invitation, you'll take on the role of player 1 whilst the other played becomes player 2. You'll be directed to the game area right after and the game begins. You take turns and try to win the game. Once the game ends, the winner (or a tie) would be declared and both the players would be returned to the homepage/lobby.
The website acts identically for each player.
The other thing to notice is that you could be on the receiving end of an invitation too and the website behaves exactly as described earlier.

When you've had a good dose of connect4 games, you can logout out from the handy link beside your name in the lobby.
